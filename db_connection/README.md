# Combining OOP and SQL :unicorn:

What I need to do:

- import connects to db
- import class of passenger 
- load information from db
- create instances of passenger with winformation from DB

`Passenger(name_from_db, id_from_db)`

I must be able to read passengers from the database, but also must commit a passenger to the database (using the 
`.commit()` command)
